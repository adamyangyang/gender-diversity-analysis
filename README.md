# Gender Diversity Analysis

## Overview
This project involves helping a company's HR department analyze the effectiveness of its employee gender diversity program.  

Although HR has been working hard to improve the gender balance at its company's various positions and departments, they're still not seeing any significant progress. 

The goal now is to help the company visualize its HR KPIs and identify potential root causes for the slow progress in their gender diversity program.
